An API that serves data for the game Terraria by RELOGIC (the game is made by RELOGIC, not the API).

## Planned functions 
- Entity relationships (for example, classes tied to the best weapon for them)

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): ^12.0.0
- [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) or any other Node.js package manager

## Installation

Install packages with your preferred package manager, e.g. npm:
```
npm install
```

## Contributing
Contributing is pretty simple if you want to add new data, about NPCs, WEAPONS, CLASSES, add functionality, improve code, just [create a new pull request] (https://github.com/diegofloresj/terraria-api/pulls) with your changes and we will review it as soon as we have time.
